# Introduction
Here, I built logistic regression from scratch for binary classification. Concretely, I used a dataset with biopsy samples for potential breast cancer to classify them as benign or malevolent.

# TL;DR


# Data
I used the 1992 [Breast Cancer Wisconsin] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/15/breast+cancer+wisconsin+original) dataset. The data was surprisingly well-annotated. See the data folder.
