# Introduction

I find that building things from scratch, if used strategically, can give you a deep understanding of your tools and help with coding and debugging. Here are some projects I have built to become a better ML engineer.
- <b>Automatic differentiation</b>. When I build my first few RL algorithms, I found that I often created bugs in the computation graph. I therefore built this project to understand the computation graph and gradient updates better.
