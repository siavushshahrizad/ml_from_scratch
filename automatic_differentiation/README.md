# Introduction
Here I built a small version of a reverse-mode auto-differentiation engine. I was motivated because my early RL scripts messed up the computation graph and the gradient calculations so I wanted to learn more. I used [Chris Colah's article](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Backprop/) as a reference for implementation.
